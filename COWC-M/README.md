(1)	Introduction

	The COWC-M dataset extends our original COWC dataset described in ECCV ’16 by labeling
	the cars with types. Each car is now labeled as either Sedan, Pickup, Other or Unknown. 
	We have also created tools to help one create new patches or extract labeled sets 
	compatible with standard detection methods such as Faster-RCNN. 
	
	You can either use the scripts provided to extract new data or you can download pre-made
	datasets from:
	
		ftp://gdo152.ucllnl.org/cowc-m/datasets/  
	
(2)	COWC-M data extraction scripts

	These are scripts for extracting training patches of different types from the COWC-M dataset. 
	Two of them will extract patches and label them for use with Caffe in a way that is similar 
	to our original patches from ECCV ’16. The main differences is that now the type of car is 
	labeled as Sedan, Pickup, Other and Unknown rather than as just ‘car’. We describe them more 
	later, but the scripts are:
	
		CreateDetectionPatches.py
		CreatePatchLabels.py
	
	Note that you can just download pre-extracted patches from our ftp at:
	
		ftp://gdo152.ucllnl.org/cowc-m/datasets/64x64_15cm_24px-exc_v5-marg-32_expanded.tgz
	
	The other script will extract cars with detection locations in a manner more compatible with 
	detection methods such as Faster-RCNN. This creates multiple patch scenes and a location label 
	for each scene. This is called:
	
		CreatePatchScenes.py
		
	It will also count the number of each car type in each image for use with the counting task. 

(3)	Creating new patches

	There are only three steps to creating your own training patches:
	
	1)	Open up the python scripts and edit the path locations at the top
	2)	Download the data files shown at the top of the script
	3)	Run the script.
	
	I have left the paths as I would use them so you can see an example of usage, but you need 
	to change these. For example:
	
	unique_list         = '/Users/mundhenk1/Downloads/temp/Objects_15cm_24px-exc_v5-marg-32.pickle'
	
	You might change to:
	
	unique_list         = '/my/directory/on/my/machine/Objects_15cm_24px-exc_v5-marg-32.pickle'
	 
	Don’t literally do this, just point it towards your local copy. 
	
	You then create new patches by first calling CreateDetectionPatches.py. This will create a set of 
	training images. Next you will need to run CreatePatchLabels.py to create a set of patch labels. 
	Once you have called both, you should have all you need to train a Caffe network on your data. 

(4)	Creating new scenes and counting

	You run this in the same way as for creating training patches, but you don’t need to run a script 
	to extract labels. This is in part because different detection engines use different labeling 
	schemes. You should use the script CreatePatchScenes.py more as an example for how to do this 
	and make changes as needed. 
	
	This method will also count the number of each type of car and put it in a single file. So, this
	can be used to create counts of cars by type for each scene.
