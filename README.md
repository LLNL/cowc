(2)	OR ... Download new scripts for our COWC-M dataset. 

	This set extends our original COWC dataset by adding labels for the types of cars. 
	These are:
	
		a)	Sedan
		b)	Pickup
		c)	Other
		d)	Unknown
	
	We have also included tools to make it easier to process our labeled data than was 
	the case previously. These scripts are in the folder COWC-M. 
	
	The README.md file in COWC-M describes this further as well as usage. On github, you
	can just click on COWC-M and it will pop up.
